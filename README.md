This repository contains a collection of python scripts for simulating and animating several different oscillatory systems.

# DDO
Simulates and animates the motion of a driven damped oscillator, where the oscillator is a mass on a spring.

# DDP
Simulates and animates the motion of a driven damped oscillator where the oscillator is a pendulum.

# doublePendulumEuler
Simulates and animates the motion of a double pendulum system using Euler's method to solve the differential equation.

# doublePendulumRK
Simulates and animates the motion of a double pendulum system using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve the differential equation.
